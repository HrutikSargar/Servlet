# Servlet

Servlets are Java classes that are used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Servlets can respond to any type of request, such as HTTP requests, by dynamically generating content.

Key Concepts
Lifecycle: Servlets have a lifecycle that is managed by the servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat). Key methods include init(), service(), and destroy().

Request and Response: Servlets handle client requests (received via HTTP, for example) and generate responses. They use HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects to interact with the request and response.

URL Mapping: Servlets are typically mapped to specific URL patterns using configuration in the web.xml file or annotations, defining which URLs they will respond to.

Session Management: Servlets can manage user sessions using features such as HttpSession to store user-specific information between requests.

Requirements
Java Version: Servlets are part of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specification. Ensure compatibility with the Java version supported by your servlet container.

Servlet Container: Deploy your Servlets in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or others.

Usage
Servlet Implementation: Implement your Servlet by extending the HttpServlet class or implementing the Servlet interface.

Request Handling: Override the doGet() or doPost() methods to handle incoming HTTP GET or POST requests.

Deployment: Package your Servlet in a WAR (Web Application Archive) file and deploy it to your servlet container.
